Description: 'Performs a standardized regression using the Lasso methodology. The 
estimates become nonzero at a point that means the variables enter the model equation 
sequentially as the scaled shrinkage parameter increases. The Lasso technique results 
in variable selection. Finally, the resulting Lasso estimates are plotted.'
